#/* BOM for O+C (rev 2c) */

- if your board is is labelled rev.2c (on top of the board, underneath the 'ornament and crime' label), that's rev 2c. previous versions differ only slightly.

- the footprint for passives is **0805 throughout**, except the four 10n caps (0603) in vicinity of the teensy. using 0603 everywhere will work just as fine, of course.

- there's four 3-pin pads for 2k trimpots (output calibration): **we recommend omitting the trimpots**, and doing the calibration entirely in software. use four **jumper wires** instead and, ideally, **0.1% resistors** for the output stage (the "wiki" has more details): it's cheaper and makes calibration easier (and no less accurate).


### SMD resistors (0805):
| value | #| part | note |
| ---: | ---: | --- | --- |
| 100R | 4x | e.g. mouser # 279-1623096-1 | 1% |
| 220R | 4x | e.g. mouser # 279-CPF0805B220RE1 | 1% |
| 510R | 2x | e.g. mouser # 603-RC0805JR-07510RL | 1-5% |
| 2k   | 1x | e.g. mouser # 660-RK73H2ATTE2001F | 1% |
| 10k  | 1x | e.g. mouser # 660-RK73H2ATTD1002F | 1-5% |
| **24k9**  | 4x | e.g. mouser # 756-PCF0805R-24K9BT1 | **0.1%**  (‡)|
| 33k | 8x | e.g. mouser # 660-RK73H2ATTD3302F | 1% |
| 49k9 | 6x | e.g. mouser # 660-RK73H2ATTD4992F | 1% / silkscreen says 2x 47k, 4x 49k9: **ignore** |
| **100k** | 4x | e.g. mouser # 279-CPF0805B100KE | **0.1%** |
| 100k | 8x | e.g. mouser # 660-RK73H2ATTD1003F| 1% (or simply get 12 x 0.1%) |

- (‡) **if** building **with** trimpots, use 24k (1%) rather than 24k9.


### trimpots (throughhole): 
| value | # | type | note |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| trimpot 50k-100k | 1x | cermet / inline / 9.5mm |  ADC/CV offset trim, [for example](http://www.taydaelectronics.com/50k-ohm-trimmer-potentiometer-cermet-25-turns-3296w.html) |
| **optional:** trimpot 2k | 4x | cermet / inline / 9.5mm | DAC output trim (**omit: use 0.1% resistors instead**) |

### SMD caps (0603) (16V) :
| value | #| type| note |
| --- | ---: | :---: | --- |
| 10n | 5x | C0G/NP0 | e.g. mouser # 81-GRM1885C1H103JA1D |

### SMD caps (0805) (25V or better):
| value | #| type | note |
| --- | ---: | :---: | --- |
| 18p-22p | 4x | **C0G/NP0** (!) | e.g. mouser # 77-VJ0805A220GXAPBC |

| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| MCP6004 | 1x | (SOIC-14) | mouser # 579-MCP6004T-I/SL |
| OPA2172 | 2x | (SOIC-8) | mouser # 595-OPA2172IDR, and see note (†) below |
| DAC8565 |  1x | (TSSOP-16) | mouser # 595-DAC8565IAPW, 595-DAC8565ICPW |
| MMBT3904 (NPN) | 4x | (SOT-23) |  mouser # 512-MMBT3904 |

| LM1117-50 | 1x | (SOT-223) |  mouser # 511-LD1117S50 |

- (†) something fancier (= more suitable, $$) than TL072 should be used for the DAC output stage; using TL072 will be ok, but ideally, you want something with (very) **low offset/noise/drift**. for example: OPA2172, OPA2277 

## misc through-hole:

| what | # | note | part | 
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |

- (†)  rotary encoder w/ switch: for instance: mouser # 652-PEC11R-4215F-S24 (15 mm, 'D' shaft); 652-PEC11R-4215K-S24 (15 mm shaft, knurled); 652-PEC11R-4220F-S24 (20 mm, 'D'), 652-PEC11R-4220K-S24 (20 mm, knurled), etc).
- (††) best to **use "machined pin" ones** (also called "round" or "precision"): the pcb holes are small.
- (†††) much cheaper is [sos](http://www.soselectronic.com/?str=371&artnum=102165&name=mec-5gth935).



## MCU/display:

| what | # | note | source |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- |
| teensy 3.2 / 3.1| 1x | **cut the V_usb/power trace!** | [oshpark](http://store.oshpark.com/products/teensy-3-1) / mouser # 485-2756 |
| OLED | 1x | SH1106 or SSD1306 / 1.3" / 128x64 | see note (†) | 

- (†) you can find these 1.3" displays on ebay or aliexpress for < 10$. as long as the description claims that they are `SH1106` or `SSD1306` and the pinout is: `GND - VCC - D0 - D1 - RST - DC - CS`, they should work (or `GND - VCC - CLK - MOSI - RES - DC - CS`, which is the same). **make sure you get the right size**: 1.3" (not 0.96")! 
- alternatively, the hardware/gerbers folder has **.brd/.sch** files for a/the OLED carrier board. in that case, you'd need to get the bare OLED. [for example here](http://www.buydisplay.com/default/serial-spi-1-3-inch-128x64-oled-display-module-ssd1306-white-on-black) (though there's cheaper options for getting bare OLEDs).
